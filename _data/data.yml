career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    As a proud academic achiever and a student leader, I put emphasis on developing 
    my own skills. I see this as an investment which I will be able to use in my future employment.
    By developing my own websites and applications through python, dart, flask, and other tools such as 
    java script, css, and flutter, I aim to be highly effective as a full stack developer.

    Moreover, studying in the College of Computer Studies at the LSPU main branch, I am able to study Machine
    Learning and A.I. development to a enchanced intent with first class performance and intelligent systems.

    To be part of a company means to work with a team, this is why I pursued to develop my team working 
    and communication skills, by working as the former President of our college's student organization, I am 
    highly efficient in conflict resolution and team management.
